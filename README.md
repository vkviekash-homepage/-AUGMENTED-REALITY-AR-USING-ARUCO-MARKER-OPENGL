An aruco marker is a fiducial marker that is placed on the object or scene being imaged. 
It is a binary square with black background and boundaries and a white generated pattern within 
it that uniquely identifies it. The black boundary helps to make their detection easier. 
They can be generated in a variety of sizes. The size is chosen based on the object size and the scene, 
for successful detection. If very small markers are not being detected, just increasing their size can make 
their detection easier. The idea is that you print these markers and put them in the real world. 
You can photograph the real world and detect these markers uniquely. After detection, the coordinates of 
the aruco maker in the frame is recorded in real-time. Now using Blender I had created a black cube which using OpenGL 
I loaded and positioned at the coordinates of aruco marker.
